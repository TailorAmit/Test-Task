# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task Summary
1. Visualize the GraphQL query response: The user should be able to access all information in some form.
2. Provide filters to search by mission and rocket name.
3. Provide some form of pagination (endless scroll or traditional pagination).
4. The user should be able to select two launch entries and click on a button “Compare” to see the results for these two launches next to each other (on a new page or in a dialog).
5.  Please add a README file to the project, where you describe your thoughts on how you
visualized the launches, what you would have done if you had more time and where you
encountered problems.
6. The README should also contain some instructions on how to run the project.

## Git clone
git clone https://github.com/TailorAmit/Test-Task.git


## cd  Folder Name
cd Test-Task

## install packegaes
npm install 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
